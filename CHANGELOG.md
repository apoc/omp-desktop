# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `/login` command with OAuth provider picker (fetches providers via `get_login_providers` RPC)
- Ask tool rendered as inline chat bubble with `rpc-ui` mode support _(requires [can1357/oh-my-pi#994](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/994) to be merged)_

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Initial Tauri 2 shell: spawns `omp --mode rpc` per tab, no bundler, JSX transpiled in-browser via `@babel/standalone`
- GitHub Actions CI (cargo check + cargo test on win/linux/mac) and release pipeline
- Per-tab omp process isolation — one process per tab, preserved across switches via session snapshots
- Model picker as a separate bridge view with on-load fetch and refresh button
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting (marked v12 + highlight.js) in chat
- Plan mode: full intent → drafting → review → running → done lifecycle with inline block annotations
- Slash command palette with arrow-key navigation, fuzzy filter, and Enter execution
- `/new` command to start a fresh omp session in the current tab
- Steer: send a message to the agent mid-turn without waiting for completion
- Compact tool cards: full expand/collapse card showing live progress and final result
- Task/quick_task tool cards: collapsible subagent panel with live-stream view on row click
- Eval cell tool cards: stream code and output live; syntax highlight on completion
- Auto-scroll chat to bottom as the agent streams output
- Minimap: dense grid heatmap with chat-bubble cross-highlight and per-kind tooltips
- Long paste collapse into `[paste #N +K lines]` inline tokens in the composer
- macOS-style traffic light window controls on Windows (DWM frameless)
- Autosave toggle button in the status bar
- Font size slider in the tweaks panel (75–150%, step 5)
- Git branch chip in the title bar via `gix` + `notify`
- OMP icon pack v1 as app icons across all platforms
- MIT license

### Fixed

- Black screen on startup — disable Tauri CSP hash injection, remove Google Fonts CDN link
- Git HEAD watcher — watch `.git/` directory instead of `HEAD` file to survive atomic rename on Linux/macOS
- Window drag — replaced custom handler with `data-tauri-drag-region`
- Diff block overflow — contained within chat column width
- Composer textarea: single-line default via `field-sizing: content`; focus restored after send; textarea stays enabled during streaming for steer input
- Phantom textarea scrollbar hidden at min-height
- Window control symbols: always colored red/yellow/green, no hover background bleed
- Tweaks panel: persist settings to `localStorage`; retheme to use app CSS variables
- Token and context gauge percentages truncated to one decimal place
- Stream line accumulation — handle in-place growing lines without duplication
- ToolCard: remove duplicate `return` statement; expand individual subagent rows, not the card header
- Plan annotations always reaching the prompt; `sendFeedback` working with annotations and no body text
- Plan running→done state transition
- Message history preserved across tab switches
- Tab name retained from folder path when `omp sessionName` is absent
- `_handleResponse` in `live.js` — missing closing brace caused silent IIFE syntax error
- Thinking level values aligned to valid RPC set (`off | minimal | low | medium | high | xhigh`)
- Rust agent: race-safe sessions, lock-free per-session stdin writes, no orphan child processes on hot-reload

### Changed

- Project renamed from `omp-desktop` to `Oh My Pi Desktop`
- Split large files into focused modules: `agent.rs` → `agent/`, `app.jsx` → `app-live.jsx` + `src/app/`, monolithic CSS and chat/UI/tweaks components into dedicated directories
- Plan mode moved from a dedicated side panel into the chat timeline
